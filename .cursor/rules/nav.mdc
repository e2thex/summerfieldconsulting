# Navigation and Header Consistency Rules

## Header Requirements
- The header should be housed in [header.html](mdc:src/_includes/header.html)
- Every page must use the exact same header structure
- Headers must include:
  - Logo linking to home (this serves as the home navigation)
  - Main navigation
  - Contact button
  - Theme toggle
  - Mobile responsive menu
  - a accessibility skip to content link
  - Do NOT include a separate "Home" link in navigation (the logo serves this purpose)


## Navigation Rules
- The nav should be identical on all pages
- The nav design should come form the home page of the site
- The nav should include all index.html pages (but by their folder name) (expect for home)
- Services dropdown
- Tools dropdown
- The nav should not include pages that do not exist
- If there are folders with no index.html then they should still be in the nav but not clickable
- Active states must be properly set for current page:
  - Current page link should have `text-accent-1` class
  - Current page link should have `aria-current="page"` attribute
  - Parent "Services" button should have `aria-current="true"` if on a service page
  - Parent "Tools" button should have `aria-current="true"` if on a tool page

## When Adding New Pages
1. Copy the complete header from an existing page
2. Update the active states for the new page's navigation
3. Add the new page to the navigation menu on ALL other pages
4. Ensure mobile menu includes the new page
5. Verify all paths (logo, CSS, etc.) are correct for the new page's directory level

## File Structure Reference
- Root pages: Use relative paths starting with `/`
- Service pages: Use relative paths starting with `../../`
- Tool pages: Use relative paths starting with `../../`
- Ensure logo.png path is correct based on page depth

## Required Classes and Attributes
Header must maintain all accessibility attributes and styling classes as defined in design.html
