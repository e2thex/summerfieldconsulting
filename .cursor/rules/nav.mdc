globs: index.html

# Your rule content

- The nav should be the same on all pages
- the nav should come from the [design.html](mdc:dist/design.html) design
- the nav should include all index.html pages (but by thier folder name) if there are folders with no index.html then it should still be in the nav but not clickable
