                    <p>Is that the end? Does that mean you will destroy the good thing that you spent the last 3 hard years building, piece by piece?</p>

                    <p>I am going to go with no, a jelled team is like Theseus Ship.</p>

                            The ship wherein Theseus and the youth of Athens returned from Crete had thirty oars, and was preserved by the Athenians down even to the time of Demetrius Phalereus, for they took away the old planks as they decayed, putting in new and stronger timber in their places...

                    <p>Did Theseus ship fail when any one board was swapped? Did it no longer float? Would it no longer have allowed them to "return from Crete?" No, it was maintained, not destroyed. In fact, what would have happened if the Athenians had said no we cannot change any part, for fear it will destroy the whole?</p>

                    <p>It would have withered away into nothing. The key here is that Jelling is the maintenance, not the Team.</p>

                    <p>As soon as we realize that jelling is a process and not a state, then how can we be scared of change? Jelling is a process of <em>constant</em> change; change is something we should embrace, not fear. If your team is Jelling that means it <em>can</em> change and that it will change well.</p>
