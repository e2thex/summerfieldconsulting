                    <p>I spend a lot of my day debating with colleagues, and I have started to see a pattern that emerges in discussions. Let us call it: Assumption of a Dichotomy.</p>

                    <p>As a quick example (let's use an oldy but a goody) imagine two friends that propose the following:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Democracy is a horrible form of Government.</li>
                        <li>Democracy is the best form of Government.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>When both of them fall victim to an assumption of a dichotomy, they respectively see the following:</p>

                    <p>They will talk past each other for hours, making statements they both might agree with, and never get anywhere because they do not have a shared understanding of the grounds on which they are arguing.</p>
                    
                    <p>It is easy to fall into this. But if they take a moment to define a shared universe instead, they would see:</p>

                    <p>My book club has been reading Deep Work which defines two kinds of work early in the book, Deep Work and Shallow Work. We kept going round in circles on whether work x was deep or shallow. Some of us saw Shallow Work as Not Deep work, some of us saw Deep Work as Not Shallow work, we all saw this world:</p>
