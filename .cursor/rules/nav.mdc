# Navigation and Header Consistency Rules

## Header Requirements
- Every page must use the exact same header structure
- Headers must include:
  - Logo linking to home (this serves as the home navigation)
  - Main navigation
  - Services dropdown
  - Contact button
  - Theme toggle
  - Mobile responsive menu
- Do NOT include a separate "Home" link in navigation (the logo serves this purpose)

## Navigation Rules
- The nav should be identical on all pages
- The nav should come from the [design.html](mdc:dist/design.html) design
- The nav should include all index.html pages (but by their folder name)
- If there are folders with no index.html then they should still be in the nav but not clickable
- Active states must be properly set for current page:
  - Current page link should have `text-accent-1` class
  - Current page link should have `aria-current="page"` attribute
  - Parent "Services" button should have `aria-current="true"` if on a service page

## When Adding New Pages
1. Copy the complete header from an existing page
2. Update the active states for the new page's navigation
3. Add the new page to the navigation menu on ALL other pages
4. Ensure mobile menu includes the new page
5. Verify all paths (logo, CSS, etc.) are correct for the new page's directory level

## File Structure Reference
- Root pages: Use relative paths starting with `/`
- Service pages: Use relative paths starting with `../../`
- Ensure logo.png path is correct based on page depth

## Required Classes and Attributes
Header must maintain all accessibility attributes and styling classes as defined in design.html
