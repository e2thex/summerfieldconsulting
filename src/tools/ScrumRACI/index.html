                            <p class="text-gray-text dark:text-dark-gray-text">
                                We developed Scrum in the early 1990s. We wrote the first version of the Scrum Guide in 2010 to help 
                                people worldwide understand Scrum. We have evolved the Guide since then through small, functional updates.

                            <p class="text-gray-text dark:text-dark-gray-text mt-4">
                                The Scrum Guide contains the definition of Scrum. Each element of the framework serves a specific purpose 
                                that is essential to the overall value and results realized with Scrum. Changing the core design or ideas 
                                of Scrum, leaving out elements, or not following the rules of Scrum, covers up problems and limits the 
                                benefits of Scrum, potentially even rendering it useless.
                            </p>

                                We follow the growing use of Scrum within an ever-growing complex world. We are humbled to see Scrum being 
                                adopted in many domains holding essentially complex work, beyond software product development where Scrum 
                                has its roots. As Scrum's use spreads, developers, researchers, analysts, scientists, and other specialists 
                                do the work. We use the word "developers" in Scrum not to exclude, but to simplify. If you get value from 
                                Scrum, consider yourself included.

                                As Scrum is being used, patterns, processes, and insights that fit the Scrum framework as described in 
                                this document, may be found, applied and devised. Their description is beyond the purpose of the Scrum 
                                Guide because they are context sensitive and differ widely between Scrum uses. Such tactics for using 
                                within the Scrum framework vary widely and are described elsewhere.

                                Scrum is simple. Try it as is and determine if its philosophy, theory, and structure help to achieve 
                                goals and create value. The Scrum framework is purposefully incomplete, only defining the parts required 
                                to implement Scrum theory. Scrum is built upon by the collective intelligence of the people using it. 
                                Rather than provide people with detailed instructions, the rules of Scrum guide their relationships and 
                                interactions.

                                management, environment, and work techniques, so that improvements can be made.

                                Scrum is founded on empiricism and lean thinking. Empiricism asserts that knowledge comes from experience

                                Scrum employs an iterative, incremental approach to optimize predictability and control risk. It engages

                                such skills as needed.

                                Scrum combines four formal events for inspection and adaptation within a containing event, the Sprint. 
                                These events work because they implement the empirical Scrum pillars of transparency, inspection, and 
                                adaptation.

                                Artifacts that have low transparency can lead to decisions that diminish value and increase risk.

                                stakeholders are open about the work and the challenges. Scrum Team members respect each other to be 
                                capable, independent people, and are respected as such by the people with whom they work. The Scrum Team

                                Scrum events and artifacts. When these values are embodied by the Scrum Team and the people they work

                                are more productive. If Scrum Teams become too large, they should consider reorganizing into multiple 
                                cohesive Scrum Teams, each focused on the same product. Therefore, they should share the same Product Goal, 
                                Product Backlog, and Product Owner.

                                Sprints are the heartbeat of Scrum, where ideas are turned into value. They are fixed length events of 
                                one month or less to create consistency. A new Sprint starts immediately after the conclusion of the 
                                previous Sprint.

                                Sprints enable predictability by ensuring inspection and adaptation of progress toward a Product Goal at 
                                least every calendar month. When a Sprint's horizon is too long the Sprint Goal may become invalid, 
                                complexity may rise, and risk may increase. Shorter Sprints can be employed to generate more learning 
                                cycles and limit risk of cost and effort to a smaller time frame. Each Sprint may be considered a short 
                                project.

                                happen is unknown. Only what has already happened may be used for forward-looking decision making.

                                    Through discussion with the Product Owner, the Developers select items from the Product Backlog to 
                                    include in the current Sprint. The Scrum Team may refine these items during this process, which 
                                    increases understanding and confidence.

                                    Selecting how much can be completed within a Sprint may be challenging. However, the more the

                                    the more confident they will be in their Sprint forecasts.

                                    For each selected Product Backlog item, the Developers plan the work necessary to create an Increment 
                                    that meets the Definition of Done. This is often done by decomposing Product Backlog items into smaller 
                                    work items of one day or less. How this is done is at the sole discretion of the Developers. No one 
                                    else tells them how to turn Product Backlog items into Increments of value.

                                size. Attributes often vary with the domain of work.

                                An Increment is a concrete stepping stone toward the Product Goal. Each Increment is additive to all previous 
                                Increments and thoroughly verified, ensuring that all Increments work together. In order to provide value, 
                                the Increment must be usable.

                                Multiple Increments may be created within a Sprint. The sum of the Increments is presented at the Sprint 
                                Review thus supporting empiricism. However, an Increment may be delivered to stakeholders prior to the end 
                                of the Sprint. The Sprint Review should never be considered a gate to releasing value.

                                The Definition of Done is a formal description of the state of the Increment when it meets the quality 
                                measures required for the product.
                            </p>

                                The moment a Product Backlog item meets the Definition of Done, an Increment is born. The Definition of 
                                Done creates transparency by providing everyone a shared understanding of what work was completed as part 
                                of the Increment. If a Product Backlog item does not meet the Definition of Done, it cannot be released 
                                or even presented at the Sprint Review. Instead, it returns to the Product Backlog for future consideration.

                                If the Definition of Done for an increment is part of the standards of the organization, all Scrum Teams 
                                must follow it as a minimum. If it is not an organizational standard, the Scrum Team must create a 
                                Definition of Done appropriate for the product.
                            </p>
                            <p class="text-gray-text dark:text-dark-gray-text mt-4">
                                The Developers are required to conform to the Definition of Done. If there are multiple Scrum Teams 
                                working together on a product, they must mutually define and comply with the same Definition of Done.
