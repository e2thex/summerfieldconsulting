                    <p>I want to start by stating that this essay is not for everyone. I think there might very well be people out there whose circumstance really do force their hand, and there are things they have to do. And there are jobs where the consequence of one's actions can have life and death effects. But chances are this is not you. And that means you don't have to do anything.</p>
                    <p>So I want to propose that if we <strong>do not</strong> have to do anything, we should stop saying that we have to. I want to offer a two-step process to move away from "have to."</p>

                    <p>There is no doer in both examples; there are only people having things done to them. It's the passive voice of responsibility. It removed all agency as well as turning off our reasoning brain.</p>

                    <p>This now gives the person you are talking to context about the choices you are making. It also opens the door for you to be wrong. They can respond with, "I hear that is important; please hear me out on my want." Or to disagree with your assessment of the situation. In short, it gives them information and an invitation to engage. By asserting your agency you also return theirs.</p>
